          <p class="text-justify">The Wooly Llama has strong wool coverage over the whole body, especially on the neck, head and ears, and down the legs to the fetlock. Body size is usually smaller than other Llama types.
            The fibre is very fine, crimped, parts easily and is interspersed with minimal fine guard hairs. Occasionally, fibre quality is approximately equal to the average alpaca . Because an undercoat is missing, the uniform fleece is referred to as "single coated".
            Though there are sure to be many awesome high-tech toys out there this holiday season, our latest obsession is the adorably low-tech wooden peg dolls by Wooly Llama on Etsy. I mean, what could be better than hearing your kids playing their own imaginary game of Star Wars while making their best beep-beep-boop noises for the wee little R2D2 peg? Or doing their own version of Harry Potter complete with a rolly-polly Hagrid?
            Beyond those two huge franchises, Wooly Llama has even more incredibly cute wooden peg dolls, with sets paying homage to the casts of Lord of the Rings, and Percy Jackson so you can pick one that appeals most to your bookworm. There are brightly colored peg doll princesses you might recognize, along with famous peg doll superheroes and Super Villains that could create some epic battle scenes all together. We also love their child-size peg doll play sets that come with a painted carrying case so that their peg dolls can come along wherever you go.</p>

          <h4>Medium Llama <small>Majestic Medium Llama</small></h4>
          <img src="images/medium_type.jpg" class="thumbnail pull-left"></img>
          <p class="text-justify">This type has longer fibres on its neck and body, but compared to the Wooly has less and shorter fibre at the head, ears and legs.
            It also differs from the Wooly in the presence of long, rough guard hairs protruding through a fine undercoat. This fleece is called "double coated" (without uniformity).
            In practice, even specialists have difficulty distinguishing this type, which results either directly or indirectly from crossing Wooly (strong coverage) and Classic (light coverage).

          <h4>Classic Llama <small>Majestic Classic Llama &#40; Ccara Sullo &#41;</small></h4>
          <img src="images/classic_type.jpg" class="thumbnail pull-left"></img>
          <p class="text-justify">The Classic Llama clearly has less fibre on its whole head, neck and legs. The body has a slightly longer hair coat, often exhibiting the form of a saddle. Some have guard hairs on the neck that look like a mane.
            The double-coated fleece, with rough guard hairs and a fine undercoat, lacks uniformity. Classic Llamas usually have a larger, taller body.
            In all species, the tried-and-true axiom is to buy and breed from the best you can possibly find. "Best," to the llama market (which changes with the winds of fashion), has included abundant wool, the most-curved and/or -warped ears, popular ancestory, and whatever colors or markings that are currently eyecatching and uncommon. None of these attributes make a tangibly better llama -- only a transiently more fashionable one.
            We have set out to define "best" in more tangible, long-lasting terms with direct applicability to the classic performance llama. In the initial selection of our breeding stock, we screened for overall health, biomechanical suitablilty for packing and driving, physical soundness over time, longevity, mental and emotional stability, and a coat that lends itself to optimum health and easy care. These attributes are not in order of preference: above-average ratings in all categories were mandatory for any llama selected for our breeding program.
            We of course have eliminated llamas with known carriers of genetic defects in their background. Although ferreting out this information can be tricky, until DNA markers are found and tests available for each defect, it's the only way to stack the odds in favor of a healthy offspring and gene pool -- thus it's a critical step for us and for anyone who buys a breeding llama from us.</p>
