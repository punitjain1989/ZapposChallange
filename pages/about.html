      <p class="text-justify paddin">Computer Science graduate student at California State University, Fullerton. Worked with a company named PTC for 4 years and 1 month on various cutting edge technologies. Widely worked on Object Oriented and Funcational programming paradigms.
        While working with PTC I leanred so many new things with my responsibilities and thought of joining a graduate program to develop my skills for next level and joined California State University, Fullerton. I won many awards and certificate while working with PTC, out of which my favourite is the IoT (Internet of Things) innovation contest. I carry good web and application development skill in technologies, such as - Java, JavaScript, AngularJS, CSS, CSS-3, HTML-5 and so on..
      I joined California State University in Fall 2016. I decided to take Cloud Computing, Advance Database Management System (Which includes big data also), and Agile Project Management courses in this semester as these technologies are changing the way application used to written and deployed. I have keen interest in developing web application besides I have more then four years of experience in developing web applications.
      Moreover, along with programming languages and web development I have experience with build tools, such as - Ant, and continous integration tools, such as - Jenkins. I have wokred in SCRUM enviounment in my previous company therefore I carry experience working in SCRUM enviournment as well.
            <br /><br />In my last year at PTC I solely worked on role based application written in AngularJS, Java script, and web development technologies. This was kind of smart connected ecommerece application. There only I developed huge interest in E-commerce industry. As Zappos Family deals in ecommerece domain and always welcome innovation, I believe zappos fits best to me.</p>
