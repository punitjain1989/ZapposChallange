Prior to joining California State University, Fullerton I worked with a company named PTC for 4 years and one month on various cutting edge technologies. I widely worked on Object Oriented and Funcational Programming paradigms. I was born in India and did my under grad and graduation from India only. While working with PTC I explored so many new things and thought of joining a graduate program to develop my skills for next level. Hence I decided to join California State University, Fullerton.
